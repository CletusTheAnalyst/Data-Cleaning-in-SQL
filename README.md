# Data Cleaning in SQL

## Welcome to the Data Cleaning in SQL repository! 

This project aims to provide practical SQL scripts and techniques for cleaning and preprocessing data within a SQL database environment. 
Whether you're a data analyst, data scientist, or database administrator or none at all, this repository can help give you an insight to data cleaning workflows directly within SQL.

## Introduction

Data cleaning is a critical step in the data preparation process. Messy, inconsistent, or erroneous data can significantly impact analysis and decision-making. 
SQL, as a powerful querying language, offers robust capabilities for data manipulation and transformation, making it an ideal tool for cleaning data directly within databases.
In this repository is a collection of my SQL scripts that address common data cleaning challenges using Housing Data. Such challenges includes:

1. Handling missing or null values
2. Standardizing formats (e.g., dates, names)
3. Removing duplicates
4. Correcting data inconsistencies
5. Transforming data for analysis

## Source of Data:
The dataset is a housing dataset from Nashville USA gotten from Kaggle, and online iternational repository of data.  
I designed each script to be adaptable and to serve as a foundation for building more complex data cleaning pipelines tailored to specific datasets or business requirements.
